## Description

My updated portfolio includes links to my GitHub & LinkedIn profile page, as well as my email address. Additionally, I have included a list of projects, which can be found here. For each project I have included a link to a deployed version and to my GitHub repository.

This is a build-in-progress React.js portfolio that will ultimately showcase my work as a Full Stack Software Developer
